# Minesweeper
The classic Minesweeper game, now on Android!

## How to play
- A rectangular board is divided into a grid of squares.
- Some of the squares contain mines, while the others are empty.
- The goal of the game is to reveal all of the empty squares without detonating any of the mines.
- Each square has a number on it, which indicates how many mines are adjacent to it.
- A player can left-click on a square to reveal it, or right-click on a square to flag it as a suspected mine.
- If a player clicks on a mine, the game ends and the player loses.
- If a player reveals all of the empty squares, the player wins.
