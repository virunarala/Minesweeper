    <string name="game_help">A rectangular board is divided into a grid of squares.
    Some of the squares contain mines, while the others are empty.
    The goal of the game is to reveal all of the empty squares without detonating any of the mines.
    Each square has a number on it, which indicates how many mines are adjacent to it.
    A player can click on a square to reveal it, or long-click on a square to flag it as a suspected mine.
    If a player clicks on a mine, the game ends and the player loses.
    If a player reveals all of the empty squares, the player wins.</string>
